A simple console-based To-Do List application written in Java.  
Users can add tasks with priorities (Low, Medium, High), remove tasks, and view their to-do list sorted by priority.

# Features #

- Add tasks with a priority level: **HIGH**, **MEDIUM**, or **LOW**.
- Tasks are automatically sorted so higher priority tasks appear first.
- Remove tasks by their number.
- Simple console interface with menu options.
- Uses two Java classes: `Task` and `ToDoList`.

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the Java files:

java ToDoList
